/*!
Tests for i18n (internationalization) functionality.

Note: These tests use `unsafe` environment variable manipulation and are
intentionally simple. In production, i18n is initialized once at startup
before any concurrency, so race conditions are not a concern. These tests
primarily serve as documentation of the i18n feature.
